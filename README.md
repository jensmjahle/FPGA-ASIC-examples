# FPGA Examples
This project contains examples demonstrating the use of FPGA and ASIC for various applications using VHDL. These examples are intended for educational purposes and are used in a lecture on FPGA and ASIC technologies for the corse IDATT2104 Networkprogramming. The examples include testbenches and can be displayed and tested using edaplayground.com.

## Prerequisites
- Browser supporting [EDAplayground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)

## Examples 
- Simple Integer Multiplication Example [Click here!](https://www.edaplayground.com/x/mQFe)

## How to run 
The easies way to run the project is to click the links above to run the corresponding example. That way everything is already setup and all you have to do is press the "run" button. Alternatively you can download the repository and use your own test environment, note that the testbench might not work correct with other simulators than the one recommended here.
